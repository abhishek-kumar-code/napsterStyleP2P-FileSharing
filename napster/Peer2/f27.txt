Google[edit]

Android 4.0.1 on the Galaxy Nexus
Google Chrome OS is designed to work exclusively with web applications. Announced on July 7, 2009, Chrome OS is currently publicly available and was released summer 2011. The Chrome OS source code was released on November 19, 2009, under the BSD license as Chromium OS.
Chromium OS is an open source operating system development version of Google Chrome OS. Both operating systems are based on the Linux kernel.
Android is an operating system for mobile devices. It consists of Android Runtime (userland) with Linux (kernel), with its Linux kernel modified to add drivers for mobile device hardware and to remove unused Vanilla Linux drivers.

ISIS, ISIS-II; "Intel Systems Implementation Supervisor" was a environment for development of software within the Intel microprocessor family in the early 1980s on their Intellec Microcomputer Development System and clones. ISIS-II worked with 8 inch floppy disks and had an editor, cross-assemblers, a linker, an object locator, debugger, compilers for PL/M, a BASIC interpreter, etc. and allowed file management through a console.
